<h1>Packing</h1>
<h2>Simulated Annealing</h2>

<p>

- A Monte Carlo simulation of circle packing, using the NPT ensemble. </br>
- Our aim is to explore various flavors of a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm in which the system was taken from an initial, low-pressure, easy-to-equilibrate state to a Ô¨Ånal, high-pressure state, via an annealing schedule consisting of a series of steps in inverse pressure. </br>
- Between each pressure increase, a Metropolis algorithm appropriate to the disc NPT ensemble is used to equilibrate the system. </br>
- The equilibration procedure consists of two types of Monte Carlo moves: translations of the circles within the box, and changes in the volume of the entire system. At each step of the equilibration procedure, a circle is selected at random; then, one of the two types of moves is selected at random, with probabilities .9, .1, for translation and volume change, respectively. </br>
- Once a circle and a move type are selected, the move is attempted. If the move results in any overlaps among the N squares, the move is rejected. If it does not, then for translation moves, the move is accepted; for volume change 'moves' that would result in a volume change dV, the volume change is accepted with probability pacc = min[1, exp(-Beta * P * dV )]. </br>
- In practice, rather than changing the volume of the entire system, the periodic box in the simulations was kept at a constant size, and the radii of the individual circles were all rescaled, in order to achieve the desired new volume.</br>
- For this initial instance of the code, the 'pressure schedule' is simplified to a simple 'jump' in pressure to the final pressure; this will be changed to a more elaborate pressure increase schedule after optimal step size parameters are determined. </br>
