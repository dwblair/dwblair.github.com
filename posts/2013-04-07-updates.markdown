- play a sound when pressing a button
- controlling stepper motors with a raspberry pi -- see tutorial [here](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-10-stepper-motors)
- control a DC motor with a raspberry pi -- tutorial [here](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-lesson-9-controlling-a-dc-motor)

what i did:

- downloaded Occidentalis from [here](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2)

- this is because it has nice support for GPIO

- used ubuntu image-writer to write the .img file to an sd card

- get an adafruit 'usbe to ttl serial cable' [here](http://www.adafruit.com/products/954)

- follow the guide for connecting to a raspberry pi with the ttl cable [here](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable)

- use [this diagram](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/connect-the-lead) for connecting the console leads on the raspberry pi

- use gtkterm on ubuntu to connect
( check which usb port with dmesg; connect using highest speed)

- [adafruit guide to using buttons](http://learn.adafruit.com/playing-sounds-and-using-buttons-with-raspberry-pi/overview)

- install the gpio module and python-dev a la instructions [here](http://learn.adafruit.com/playing-sounds-and-using-buttons-with-raspberry-pi/install-python-module-rpi-dot-gpio)

- installed 'streamer' sudo apt-get install streamer
